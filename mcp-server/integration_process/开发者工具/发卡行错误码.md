# 发卡行错误码

当卡交易被发卡行拒绝时,PayerMax会通过卡组织网络接收到特定的响应代码以及拒绝原因。我们将这些发卡行拒绝码、潜在的拒绝原因解释以及建议的后续处理步骤提供给您,便于您能快速理解为什么支付失败,以及后续的处理措施有哪些。

其中发卡行错误码、错误描述将在支付失败后通过`issuerResponseCode`、`issuerResponseMsg`返回给您,若你希望在API响应中获取到该响应,请联系PayerMax技术支持为您提供集成指引。

**注意**：尽管我们提供了最详尽的可用信息,但出于发卡行以及PayerMax的隐私和安全政策,某些拒绝原因可能不会被完全公开。如果在您接收到来自发卡行的错误码及错误描述时,您仍然不知道交易被拒的真实原因,通常情况下,建议持卡人联系其发卡行进一步咨询。
